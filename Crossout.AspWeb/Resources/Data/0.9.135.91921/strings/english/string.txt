After all, those who wear such a badge were among the first to be hit by Crossout who realized what opportunities it reveals.

"Greatescape_FightOff_psycho_text2"	"Ha-ha, we found your car first. Try to take it back!"
"Greatescape_FightOff_psycho_text3"	"I don't know why you need this car. But it's mine now!"
"Greatescape_FightOff_scavengers_text"	"How do you like our defences? The truck stays, and you get out!"
"Greatescape_FightOff_scavengers_text2"	"So we took your truck. If you try something stupid, it's your own fault now."

"Greatescape_Start_nomads_text"	"Came for the cargo? You can try if you think you're good enough. We've seen your kind already."

"Greatescape_Start_nomads_text3"	"Can you hear me? We know what you're thinking. And we're going to stop you."
"Greatescape_Start_psycho_text"	"What, you want you truck back? Get lost, before my guys trash your cars! "

"Mask_14_Desc"	"Centenarian is quite famous in the Valley, but nobody really knows his true name or date of birth. People have been gossiping about the unsinkable old man for a long time and wondering how he's still alive, since people of old age are as rare in the Wasteland as pure water.|A certain local lunatic convinced the folk that Centenarian was infected with the crossout virus back during the disaster and stopped aging. And it would not be so terrifying if it weren't for the rumours that Centenarian is a living corpse. He can get any injury and survive, but he can't heal even the slightest wounds. So he often used to join raids himself, but these days he mostly commands from afar."

"Mask_Australian_Dendy_Desc"	"His life barely changed after the disaster. He used to live in the wildest places, away from people, and he still does just that.

Now he rides through the Wasteland and thinks about something of his own."

"Mask_Boar_desc"	"The Hunter used to prey on wild animals, and loved to keep the trophies as keepsakes that adorned his hut and car. Now he hunts people. His victims are easy to identify, since their bodies often lack a finger, a tooth, or something much worse. People say that The Hunter keeps these treacherous trophies in his lair. But, frankly, one shouldn't believe rumours.  After all, no one knows where this lair is, not to mention coming back from there alive."
"Mask_Boar_name"	"Jager"
"Mask_DLC_2_Desc"	"Shortly after he'd lost his eye Wotan started to see the world in a different light. Any technical design looked like a flat blueprint to him. All shortcomings became glaringly obvious and Wotan immediately sought to correct them by adding new parts to blueprints. Fenrir is one of Wotan's first creations from the times when he still had a different name."
"Mask_DLC_2_name"	"Wotan"
"Mask_DLC_3_Desc"	"He didn't remember how he found himself on the road. There was an explosion. Something was burning, someone was running, he was dragged somewhere and bandaged. Then he was walking by himself. For a very long time. First, people tried to cover him from the sun and give him some water, but soon they left him alone. So he walked and walked until, exhausted, he fell in some forgotten garage. There he gradually regained his sanity and the skills of a mechanic. There he assembled the Tramp."
"Mask_DLC_tank_Desc"	"That night Fedor turned exactly 100 years old. But he did not know this, for he had been in a coma for months now, entangled in wires and tubes, and had seen an endless dream in which he, young and full of strength and hatred, was seated behind the levers of his beloved thirty-four. Just one last tank and I'm done, well, one more... And death continued to pass him by.|When the life support system failed, the lights went out, and no one came, Fedor opened his eyes. He got up from the hospital bed and walked slowly down the corridors littered with debris and bodies, stepped into the wide courtyard that had always looked like a parade ground, and laughed.|His body was again full of energy and there was a whole world where his hands were once again needed, missing the levers and the trigger.|He got a simple nickname: “Tankman”. For his love of tracked vehicles and large cannons. And for hatred of everything else."

"Mask_Firestarters_1_name"	"Vesuvius"
"Mask_Firestarters_3_Desc"	"Came from the south a few years after the disaster. Firestarters did not ask him what he had been doing all this time, and they deserved the trust of Sangay. The silent warrior, obediently carrying out the strictest orders, quickly fit into the gang and won the favour of their leader, Odeon, and rose to the honorary post of the standard-bearer (and sometimes the assassin).|But these days such unconditional devotion to anything is hard to believe. Most likely, Sangay experienced something so terrifying during the disaster that all he's left with is following someone else's orders."
"Mask_Firestarters_3_name"	"Sangay"
"Mask_firestarters_bundle_1_Desc"	"Once upon a time, Red Hot had a name that was not so terrible, he performed in a fire show and was the most enthusiastic artist in his group. But the all-consuming passion for fire and carelessness cost him his career, and his partner's life. After this incident, he vowed never to handle fire again.|But after the disaster everything started spinning like poi at a show. The ability to deftly and effectively manage the fire element gained Red Hot respect among Lunatics. And soon he was promoted to an Arsonist. He changed his name and image to Red Hot, put on frightening war paint and sat behind the wheel of an insane craft, which he found on the set of some B-movie.|Now he loves to saw and burn all those who are disliked by Firestarters, and he tries not try to remember the broken oath and the old friend. What an upstanding guy!"

"Mask_Germany_Raider_Desc"	"One of the first to join Martin's campaign, and later became his advisor and personal mechanic. Although only slightly older than his leader, Augustus often gave him valuable advice and deterred him from excessive violence, thus contributing to the growth of the Knechte army.|Ruthless to the enemies of the Knechte."
"Mask_Halloween_2017_1_Desc"	"Hyde always avoided people and was not burdened by it. But soon after the disaster, his memory began to fail. And when he woke up, new injuries appeared on his hands, as if he were trying to dig the earth with his bare hands.

"mask_ambulance_desc"	"Spent many weaks trying to treat those who'd contracted the disease known as Crossout, but the cure was never found. Seen enough and heard enough from the dying people to lose his mind. Now he can hear voices calling for help and see things that are not really there (or the others somehow didn't notice them?).|Now Mortus believes that life is a disease that struck the Earth, and he does everything in his power to ease the suffering of his patients and cure the planet."

"Mask_DLC_1_Desc"	"Shaman got his vehicle blueprint as a gift from the spirits on the night when he attached the final feather to his eagle garment, and first went to the overworld. There he saw a lot of steel birds and strange creatures with glowing eyes. One of them pointed its talon at a shining shape that captured Shaman's imagination. Since then he has been travelling the Wasteland and collecting parts for his “Talon”."

"Mask_Firestarters_2_Desc"	"You won't confuse Etna with any other girl from the Wasteland — her height and bright red hair really make her stand out. She was born among Firestarters after the disaster and was named in honour of the active volcano. She always follows their ritual chariots and one day wants to get behind the wheel of one of them. The only one who does not fear the rage of the raging Vesuvius and can calm him down. Has an affectionate nickname “kind volcano”."

"Mask_football_Desc"	"Hector is the most violent football fan in the Wasteland, yet also the best sports journalist. Some joke that this is only because there are neither sports, nor journalists left after the disaster. But this guy is really good at everything concerning loud shouting, whistling and brawling.  He always wanted to associate his life with sports, and when the world went to hell, he decided that the apocalypse is not an excuse to give up his goals. Idealists are having a hard time, so Hector often remained without a livelihood, but Scar AB recently noticed him and invited him to help organize the Steel Championship."

They shot me — I've had worse, they weren't throwing acid at me. They threw acid... alright, now it's time to start a gang and show these bastards that NOBODY CAN PUSH A GOOD MAN. Otherwise, other good men are going to push them."

"Mask_Maxine_Desc"	"Everyone had to stay home alone once. But not Maxine. As a child, she found a walkie-talkie and has never left if behind since. A voice emerged from it at night and told Maxine amazing stories: about the silent stars in the sky and mysterious ships she had to watch.|A quiet life came to an end in a couple of years, when the voice ordered Maxine to smash all TVs in the house and run to the forest, fleeing from the impending disaster. A few days later, the disaster struck.|Much blood has flowed since then, the voice's requests have become stranger and stranger, but Maxine trusts her old friend and waits for it to predict a new catastrophe. This time the crazy girl will no go unheard, since the whole world has gone crazy."

"Mask_PSN_Exclusive_pack_Desc"	"Hunter was a very good cop, even too good. Especially when it came to search and arrest of illegal aliens. And he would have been a detective, if not for his temper and cases of insubordination. Some even believed that his place was on the other side of the bars.||When the civilization collapsed, he left the city, protecting a group of survivors from looters and madmen. For some time they roamed the now-wild places together, saving more survivors, and soon established a small settlement, for which Hunter became the law.|The need to kill made Hunter even more violent and arrogant. And his usual xenophobia became accompanied by dislike of the Lost.||And one day he refused to shelter a heavily bandaged red-skinned person, and beat the poor fellow with his faithful baton in the process. When Hunter repented and followed the uninvited guest to apologize for the outburst of rage, he found only a pile of rags. |And in the morning the village was filled with swarms of huge red ants, devouring everything but the sand and literally razed it to the ground. Not everyone managed to escape... ||Since then, Hunter has never removed his glasses and masks, as if hiding his face, or something else."

His physical health recovered, but Caleb could not fully recover mentally and was dismissed with honour from the armed forces.|He could only find work as a taxi driver, but eventually fell in love with his job and his car.|Combat skills helped him survive the catastrophe and even take a few passengers to a safe place. In the first days after the disaster, he went to the city to save civilians again and again, but every clash with looters caused irreparable damage to his psyche. Caleb grew increasingly disappointed in humanity. Gradually, he began to forget words and was increasingly prone to fits of uncontrollable rage. After one of these attacks, he wandered alone into the Wasteland, where he disappeared without a trace.|A few years later, rumours began circulating about a madman named Caliban, who attacks travellers by an abandoned landfill and drives the corpses of his victims in the passenger seat of his black-and-orange car. And when even the skeleton crumbles, he goes in search of a new companion.|They say that his car was seen nearby."
