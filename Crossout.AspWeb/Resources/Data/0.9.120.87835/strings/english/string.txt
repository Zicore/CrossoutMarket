After all, those who wear such a badge were among the first to be hit by Crossout who realized what opportunities it reveals.

"Commtowers_Defeat_scavengers_text2"	"Good job! I wonder what we can build from the attackers' cars."
"Commtowers_Defeat_scavengers_text3"	"Nice, now bring me my wrench. So much debris left after them."
"Commtowers_LoadTower2_nomads_text"	"Found more equipment for hacking? Calm down. Defend it, otherwise we will lose the remaining tower."
"Commtowers_LoadTower2_nomads_text2"	"So many armored cars can't be a coincidence. Treachery? Squad, intercept the enemy and interrogate him!"
"Commtowers_LoadTower2_nomads_text3"	"So the operation was well-planned. Interesting. Let's see who's got a better strategy."
"Commtowers_LoadTower2_psycho_text"	"What? More machinery? Are they going to try the same trick again? Not on my watch!"
"Commtowers_LoadTower2_psycho_text2"	"Stealing hardware? Again?! Stop it, just once was enough!"
"Commtowers_LoadTower2_psycho_text3"	"Sigh, why are you so silly. We didn't like your stuff right off the bat. Why would we need more?!"
"Commtowers_LoadTower2_scavengers_text"	"Intercepting another cargo of electronics. Don't let the enemy get to it! Hurry!"
"Commtowers_LoadTower2_scavengers_text2"	"Damn, they have another tech stash? Intercept it. Now!"
"Commtowers_LoadTower2_scavengers_text3"	"We're building cars from scrap and they're leaving hacking equipment on the road! They prepared well."

"Commtowers_Start_nomads_text"	"Someone secretly delivered the tower hacking equipment to our territory. Presumably. Establish observation of the tech."
"Commtowers_Start_nomads_text2"	"Interference from the outside. But we were ready for it. Everyone, stay alert."
"Commtowers_Start_nomads_text3"	"Data intercept attempt? Useless and pathetic. But stay on your toes."
"Commtowers_Start_psycho_text"	"HARD! ROCK! ALL... Quiet! What's that on the horizon? They're dragging something to the tower! Get in your cars!"
"Commtowers_Start_psycho_text2"	"Shh! Hear that? Turn it down! Are they dragging something here? Can't tell. Go have a look."
"Commtowers_Start_psycho_text3"	"So I saw some stuff next to our towers. I dunno what it's for, but let's get it. Why waste good stuff?"
"Commtowers_Start_scavengers_text"	"I've got reports of unmanned machinery near comm tower. Sending scouts to investigate."
"Commtowers_Start_scavengers_text2"	"What are those crates on the horizon? Get some scouts there. Take them to the tower, we'll salvage them here."
"Commtowers_Start_scavengers_text3"	"I'm all out of nuts and bolts, and there's some tech just lying around. Check if we can salvage it."
"Commtowers_Tower1Def2_nomads_text"	"Enemy is at the second tower. That's just what I waited for. Go and recapture to the first one!"
"Commtowers_Tower1Def2_nomads_text2"	"The enemy's divided. The rest is a mere formality. Increase the push."
"Commtowers_Tower1Def2_nomads_text3"	"There's very little chance of holding both objectives. All according to plan. Concentrate on the first structure."
"Commtowers_Tower1Def2_psycho_text"	"Ha-ha! No chance they may defend both towers at the same time! Let's see them try!"
"Commtowers_Tower1Def2_psycho_text2"	"And now we go to the second tower while they're busy with the first! Move! Move!"
"Commtowers_Tower1Def2_psycho_text3"	"Shh. Guys, let's get to the first tower quietly. They won't know what hit them. What's that light? I have my radio on?!"
"Commtowers_Tower1Def2_scavengers_text"	"The first tower has no guards. This is our chance!"
"Commtowers_Tower1Def2_scavengers_text2"	"Great, we pulled them away from the first tower. Let's get back there!"
"Commtowers_Tower1Def2_scavengers_text3"	"The plan worked, their defence of the first tower weakened. Let's go!"
"Commtowers_Tower1Def_nomads_text"	"Lost connection to the tower! Get to the cars! The data cannot fall into the wrong hands."
"Commtowers_Tower1Def_nomads_text2"	"Luck is powerless against the mind. It's useless. Send the squad, let our enemies prepare to die."
"Commtowers_Tower1Def_nomads_text3"	"Interesting. Very. Squad, stop their interference with the towers."
"Commtowers_Tower1Def_psycho_text"	"The music's gone. What's that? The tower is under attack! All hands to the tower!"
"Commtowers_Tower1Def_psycho_text2"	"That's it. I'll rip you to shreds. MORE BLOOD!"
"Commtowers_Tower1Def_psycho_text3"	"Oh, I see what all this stuff was for — to take our tower! Let's show them why we need our guns!"
"Commtowers_Tower1Def_scavengers_text"	"Damn it! The equipment we found was the hacking tech. The scouts are dead, and the tower was intercepted! Squad, to battle!"
"Commtowers_Tower1Def_scavengers_text2"	"I told you to bring the tech, not the trouble with it! We lost a tower. Get all the free cars there!"
"Commtowers_Tower1Def_scavengers_text3"	"Damn! The scout cars are useless. The enemy is trying to intercept our tower. The last to get there is salvaged!"
"Commtowers_Tower2Def_nomads_text"	"Second tower hacked. This brings us shame. Retake it and quickly."
"Commtowers_Tower2Def_nomads_text2"	"Squad, this is our only chance. Retake the tower. Now."
"Commtowers_Tower2Def_nomads_text3"	"The strategy is falling apart. Unpleasant. But not fatal. Team, find and destroy the enemy."
"Commtowers_Tower2Def_psycho_text"	"Two towers for four snouts? Isn't that too much? Brothers, let's show them how we deal with pigs!"
"Commtowers_Tower2Def_psycho_text2"	"Damn, what are you doing?! We lost the second tower too! Get all the cars there! Make them regret this!"
"Commtowers_Tower2Def_psycho_text3"	"We gave you the first tower but the second is ours! Get the bastards!"
"Commtowers_Tower2Def_scavengers_text"	"What the hell, the second tower is captured! Get some cars there, now!"
"Commtowers_Tower2Def_scavengers_text2"	"What the hell! We lost the second tower. Go there now!"
"Commtowers_Tower2Def_scavengers_text3"	"Lost contact with the second tower. Why would these savages need such complex tech? They're gonna break it. Get ready to intercept!"
"Commtowers_Win_nomads_text"	"We lost. I am giving up."
"Commtowers_Win_nomads_text2"	"Squad destroyed. I accept defeat."
"Commtowers_Win_nomads_text3"	"Another strategy crumbles because of you, amateurs. Disgusting."
"Commtowers_Win_psycho_text"	"Damn, guys, turn back. We'll return another time!"
"Commtowers_Win_psycho_text2"	"Ha-ha! Wait, we didn't win? Damn it!"
"Commtowers_Win_psycho_text3"	"Forget it! Old tech is nothing but trouble. Let's go, guys!"
"Commtowers_Win_scavengers_text"	"We can't take them! Better retreat."
"Commtowers_Win_scavengers_text2"	"Enough! We can't lose more cars. Retreat!"
"Commtowers_Win_scavengers_text3"	"I can't watch our armored cars turn into junk any more. Leave the towers, let's go!"

And it would not be so terrifying if it weren't for the rumours that Centenarian is a living corpse. He can get any injury and survive, but he can't heal even the slightest wounds.

Just one last tank and I'm done, well, one more... And death continued to pass him by.|When the life support system failed, the lights went out, and no one came, Fedor opened his eyes. He got up from the hospital bed and walked slowly down the corridors littered with debris and bodies, stepped into the wide courtyard that had always looked like a parade ground, and laughed.|His body was again full of energy and there was a whole world where his hands were once again needed, missing the levers and the trigger.|He got a simple nickname: “Tankman”.

"mask_ambulance_desc"	"Spent many weaks trying to treat those who'd contracted the disease known as Crossout, but the cure was never found. Seen enough and heard enough from the dying people to lose his mind.

Some joke that this is only because there are neither sports, nor journalists left after the disaster. But this guy is really good at everything concerning loud shouting, whistling and brawling.  He always wanted to associate his life with sports, and when the world went to hell, he decided that the apocalypse is not an excuse to give up his goals. Idealists are having a hard time, so Hector often remained without a livelihood, but Scar AB recently noticed him and invited him to help organize the Steel Championship."

"Mask_Maxine_Desc"	"Everyone had to stay home alone once. But not Maxine. As a child, she found a walkie-talkie and has never left if behind since. A voice emerged from it at night and told Maxine amazing stories: about the silent stars in the sky and mysterious ships she had to watch.|A quiet life came to an end in a couple of years, when the voice ordered Maxine to smash all TVs in the house and run to the forest, fleeing from the impending disaster. A few days later, the disaster struck.|Much blood has flowed since then, the voice's requests have become stranger and stranger, but Maxine trusts her old friend and waits for it to predict a new catastrophe. This time the crazy girl will no go unheard, since the whole world has gone crazy."

"Mask_PSN_Exclusive_pack_Desc"	"Hunter was a very good cop, even too good. Especially when it came to search and arrest of illegal aliens. And he would have been a detective, if not for his temper and cases of insubordination. Some even believed that his place was on the other side of the bars.||When the civilization collapsed, he left the city, protecting a group of survivors from looters and madmen. For some time they roamed the now-wild places together, saving more survivors, and soon established a small settlement, for which Hunter became the law.|The need to kill made Hunter even more violent and arrogant. And his usual xenophobia became accompanied by dislike of the Lost.||And one day he refused to shelter a heavily bandaged red-skinned person, and beat the poor fellow with his faithful baton in the process. When Hunter repented and followed the uninvited guest to apologize for the outburst of rage, he found only a pile of rags. |And in the morning the village was filled with swarms of huge red ants, devouring everything but the sand and literally razed it to the ground. Not everyone managed to escape... ||Since then, Hunter has never removed his glasses and masks, as if hiding his face, or something else."
"Mask_XBOX_Exclusive_pack_Desc"	"A battle car pilot Caleb Virkist was wounded in the head during a peacekeeping mission in one of the hot spots. His physical health recovered, but Caleb could not fully recover mentally and was dismissed with honour from the armed forces.|He could only find work as a taxi driver, but eventually fell in love with his job and his car.|Combat skills helped him survive the catastrophe and even take a few passengers to a safe place. In the first days after the disaster, he went to the city to save civilians again and again, but every clash with looters caused irreparable damage to his psyche. Caleb grew increasingly disappointed in humanity. Gradually, he began to forget words and was increasingly prone to fits of uncontrollable rage. After one of these attacks, he wandered alone into the Wasteland, where he disappeared without a trace.|A few years later, rumours began circulating about a madman named Caliban, who attacks travellers by an abandoned landfill and drives the corpses of his victims in the passenger seat of his black-and-orange car. And when even the skeleton crumbles, he goes in search of a new companion.|They say that his car was seen nearby."
