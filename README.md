# Readme Update: 2019-05-24
A few months ago, when a Crossout patch encrypted the game files, we contacted the developers of Crossout and we got in touch whith each other. They worked with us to provide a very basic, private API to get the current market data every ~5 min. This enabled us to continue this project.

Crafting Calculator, Price Graphs, Margins and more.
===

This is the Open Source Project for Crossout Market found here: http://crossoutdb.com/ it provides out of game prices, buy and sell offers as well as price and volume graphs. Also new are item stats, item descriptions, filters and improved usage of [datatables](https://datatables.net/).

**This readme currently only covers some basics, please join our IRC channel if you need any help, with setting everything up properly.**

You will need a few things to setup first:

* MySQL Server 5.x
* Visual Studio with .Net 4.6 installed.
* Some experience with Web Development.

Start with Forking the repo and import the MySQL from /Schema/crossout_structure_and_data_no_market.sql on your machine.

Then create the settings file in %appdata%/CrossoutWeb/WebSettings.json or start the project once since the file is created then and edit the file.
```json
{
  "CurrentVersion": "0.7.0",
  "DatabaseName": "crossout",
  "DatabaseHost": "localhost",
  "DatabasePassword": "your db password",
  "DatabaseUsername": "your db username",
  "DatabasePort": 3306,
  "SignalrHost": "localhost",
  "WebserverPort": 80,
  "DataHost": "localhost",
  "GoogleConsumerKey": "",
  "GoogleConsumerSecret": "",
  "FileCarEditorWeaponsExLua": "Resources\\Data\\0.7.0\\gamedata\\def\\ex\\car_editor_weapons_ex.lua",
  "FileCarEditorCabinsLua": "Resources\\Data\\0.7.0\\gamedata\\def\\ex\\car_editor_cabins.lua",
  "FileCarEditorDecorumLua": "Resources\\Data\\0.7.0\\gamedata\\def\\ex\\car_editor_decorum.lua",
  "FileCarEditorWheelsLua": "Resources\\Data\\0.7.0\\gamedata\\def\\ex\\car_editor_wheels.lua",

  "FileStringsEnglish": "Resources\\Data\\0.7.0\\strings\\english\\string.txt"
}
```

You may need to start Visual Studio as Administrator for Nancy or Owins Selfhost to work.

CrossoutDB API
===
Our api provides all data we have gathered so far, in an easy to use form.

# Current API Version 1

## General Information about the API

The API provides Json formatted data models and are as self-explanatory as possible, if you have any questions you can join our IRC channel and we try to help.

All API endpoints currently use GET.

Even though the API is versioned, it can still change at any time without further notice. Hopefully there will be only fixes, but you have been warned :)

Do you have Ideas for more endpoints? Join our IRC or make an issue on our Github repository to tell us :)

## Base URL
```
/api/v1/
```
## Rarities

Results a list of all rarities

```
/api/v1/rarities
```

## Factions

Results a list of all factions

```
/api/v1/factions
```

## Types

Results a list of all types

```
/api/v1/types
```

## Categories

Results a list of all categories

```
/api/v1/categories
```

## Items

Results a list of items, optionally filtered by parameters.

```
/api/v1/items
/api/v1/items?rarity=&category=&faction=&removedItems=&metaItems=&query=
```

Optional Parameters
```
rarity : filters by rarity
category : filters by category
faction : filters by factions
removedItems : shows removed items (default false)
metaItems : shows meta items (default false)
query : search string
```

Filters except the search query are omitted if they do not match one of the corresponding options.
Use the designated endpoints (described above) to get a list of possible options.

Examples
```
/api/v1/items?query=shotgun
/api/v1/items?rarity=rare&category=weapon
```

## Item

Results one item.

```
/api/v1/item/{item}
```

Mandatory Parameter
```
{item:int} : item id
```

Examples
```
/api/v1/item/1
```

## Recipe

Results the recipe of the given item. Includes the item and item stats for the item itself.

The recipe data structure is kind of complex and consists of all fields, we need on our site.

```
/api/v1/recipe/{item:int}
```

Mandatory Parameter
```
{item:int} : item id
```

Examples
```
/api/v1/recipe/1
```

## Recipe Deep

Results the recipe of the given item. Includes the item and item stats for the item itself.

Recursively results all the ingredients for the items ingredients too.

```
/api/v1/recipe-deep/{item:int}
```

Mandatory Parameter
```
{item:int} : item id
```

Examples
```
/api/v1/recipe-deep/1
```

## Market

Results the market data in the form of an array. The First column is the timestamp and the second is the raw data value.

```
/api/v1/market/{name}/{id:int}
```

Mandatory Parameters
```
{name} : market column (sellprice, buyprice, selloffers, buyorders)
{item:int} : item id
```

Optional Parameters
```
unixTimestamp : use unix timestamps instead of the datetime type
```

```
/api/v1/market/buyprice/1
/api/v1/market/selloffers/1?unixTimestamp
```

So to format, just divide by 100. For Example: `5125 / 100 = 51.25`

## Market All

Results all columns of market data in the form of an array.

```
0 = id
1 = sellprice
2 = buyprice

```

```
/api/v1/market-all/{id:int}
```

Mandatory Parameters
```
{item:int} : item id
```

Optional Parameters
```
startTimestamp : retrieve records starting from specified unix timestamp
endTimestamp : limit results to records preceding specified unix timestamp
```

```
http://localhost/api/v1/market-all/1
http://localhost/api/v1/market-all/1?startTimestamp=1509995910&endTimestamp=1509996509

How are we gathering Data
===

## General Data

* Items
* Recipes
* Categories
* Types
* Rarities
* Factions

Manual Work, we go ingame and enter it manually in our database :smile:

## Market Data
We are working with the developers of Crossout and have a very basic, readonly, private API access to the market data, which updates every ~5 minutes.

## Stats and Descriptions
This is not really possible anymore, the files are encrypted now.

FAQ
===

Update: 2019-05-24

Q: I don't find the part that reads the data from the market in your repo.

A: It's not part of the repository and not open source (yet), we currently use a very simple tool that queries the private API we have to the Crossout market.

&nbsp;

Q: Can you implement feature XYZ.

A: Sure, we are allways open for suggestions, but we also have our own ideas and todo lists and we are working on this project in our free time.

&nbsp;

Q: Where do I find the game files.

A: They are in the Crossout installation folder, you just need to unpack them. Contact us for more information.
